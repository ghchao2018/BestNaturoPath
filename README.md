# BestNaturoPath

This is a research-based project aiming at studying Natural Language Processing(NLP) and Data Analytics.

The purpose of this project is to provide a system, which can be used to guide the user to describe his/her symptoms (using natural language in English language or Chinese) and be guided through the interview until a likely set of diseases are identified as potential causes, which the physician can investigate).  The system can then offer a naturopathic plan, foods to take and avoid, plus lifestyle recommendations.  

The project is composed of the following two parts:

## Speech Recognition Application Development:
